## Description

This project allows you to build APIs that can be deployed in AWS Lambda or dockerized for EKS or ECS.

If you are a small startup with a tight budget, you can use this project to easily build 
and deploy APIs in AWS Lambda at the early stage of development. 
You donâ€™t have to worry about scaling or managing the infrastructure, 
as AWS Lambda does it for you.

If you want to switch to Kubernetes later, 
you can also dockerize your APIs and deploy them in EKS or ECS. 
This gives you more flexibility and control over your deployment environment.
